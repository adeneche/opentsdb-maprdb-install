OpenTSDB/MapR-DB installation script
====================================

The goal of this script is to make it easier to run OpenTSDB on a MapR-DB cluster.
The only requirements is to have mapr-client (or mapr-core) installed and to install OpenTSDB
either by downloading the latest .rpm/.deb or by building from source then calling 'make install' from the build folder.
